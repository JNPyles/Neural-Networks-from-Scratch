# Neural-Networks-from-Scratch
Building neural networks using Python and NumPy based on [Neural Networks from Scratch by Kinsley &amp; Kukiela](https://nnfs.io/).

##Terms

###Data
Array: a common programming data structure consisting of a homogeneous (same type of data) container of numbers; used in NumPy
List: Python data structure similar to an array but can contain non-homogenous data.
Scalar: a single number; rank 0 tensor
Vector: a 1-dimensional container of numbers; a list in python; an array in NumPy; rank 1 tensor
Matrix: a 2-dimensional container of numbers; a list of lists in python; a 2D array in NumPy; rank 2 tensor
Tensor: an N-dimensional; in PyTorch or TensorFlow scalars, vectors, and matrices are all tensors. Tensors can be represented as arrays.
Dimension: the number of indices needed to locate a specific number in a tensor (for example, a list of lists has 2-dimensions, and 2 numbers are needed to locate a specific number in this tensor); the number of indices can be represented as an array/list/vector/tensor, which means the number of dimensions can be determined by counting the number of items in the array. 

###Operations:
Cross product: Results in a vector.
Dot product: Results in a scalar.
